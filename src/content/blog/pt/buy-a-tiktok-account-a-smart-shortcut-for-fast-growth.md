Well, a pre-existing account that regularly posts good content on a specific topic usually has good engagement rates. Purchasing such an account helps you put in less effort and skip engagement strategies that may not work for you. This way, you can promote your product or services with minimal effort.

Also, its organic followers can give you access to other income streams like the Creator Fund, TikTok Series, subscriptions, and product sales. With everything set up, you can make money right away. 
## Why Do People Sell Their TikTok Accounts? ##
There are two main reasons why people sell TikTok accounts and these are:
1. Creators sell TikTok accounts to get profit from their hard work or recover investments. Selling accounts of some top niches like technology, healthcare, beauty, etc. generate good income.   
2. Due to some life events like mental disturbance, some sellers simply want to step away from social media. Therefore, they sell their TikTok account instead of deleting it. 
Therefore, with the right strategy, selling TikTok accounts can be a profitable move for both creators and buyers.

## Steps to Securely Buy a TikTok Account ##
Several factors are essential to keep in mind before you buy a TikTok account. To get an advantage from your investments, learn about the platform, as it helps you stay away from scams. Similarly, other reasons you should need to know before making a purchase are:

### 1. Verify Account Authenticity ###
Fake followers can affect your service, brand, or product badly. Therefore, verify that the account has real followers who engage with most of the posts. To check organic engagement, you can compare reactions and comments on videos with the number of followers. 
### 2. Relevancy ###
Pick an account that aligns with your niche and has content that suits your brand or service needs. The demographics and interests of the audience matter the most and should match the buyer’s target market.
### 3. Find a Trustworthy Seller ###
Make sure that you buy TikTok accounts from trusted sellers like TTNexus, etc. as it reduces the risk of scams. Moreover, they provide accounts with real followers, good engagement rates, proper security, future support, and more. 
### 4. Get Complete Account Access ###
Get complete access to the account from the seller, including the email that was used for the registration of that TikTok account. Without proper ownership transfer, do not pay. You can use escrow services to send payments in a smooth and secure way. Importantly, stay away from low-cost deals, as most of these are fake ones. 
### 5. Check Bans and Restrictions ###
Make sure that the account hasn’t been restricted or banned by TikTok before making a purchase. This helps you avoid future bans that could affect your reach and engagement.
### 6. Follow TikTok Policies ###
Lastly, you should read about the platform policies and follow them. For example, TikTok does not allow trading. If you violate their policies, you may face account suspension later on.
